"""
Church Financial Accounting Program (CFAP) was created to give 
local churches and small NPOs a resource in keeping transparent and accountable
financial documents. It was developed from the need that current finance
software was either too costly and/or advanced and free software did 
not work with multiple languages or currencies and/or was not user friendly.

"Feel free to download and try the program. This program is not feature complete at the moment, but should be usable."

"At the moment translations for Russian and Ukrainian are far from complete."
"If you would like to add translations, please see the 'locales/*.pot' files. (Although they may not be fully up-to-date.)"

USAGE is under MIT Licensing, but I would be interested to know where the program is used!
